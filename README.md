## About this app

This app is mock GPT3 app which I created to practice React and CSS styling.

It contains a variety of sections that can be accessed from the headings which will auto-scroll to the selected area.

There are a variety of React components and containers used to create the various sections of the site from the Header to the blog, info, footer and more.

### Functionality & Key Features

The site is fully adjustable for screen sizes ranging from mobile to desktop.

I followed a tutorial created by JavaScriptMastery to become more proficient with JavaScript React and work more with CSS styling.
